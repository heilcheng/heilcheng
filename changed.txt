Hi.

I have learnt my lesson from both parties's legal department and have severely paid for my mistakes.

Would you mind and be willing to take down the thread post that you made?

I myself don't want to drag down the reputation of those parties even further because of my honest mistake that I genuinely regret and paid heavily already.


Thank you, enjoy your holiday. You are free now, please dont burden yourself anymore than this.
